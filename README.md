# Windows11Debloater
This is a tool I've created to debloat Windows 11 with the option to customize the color display for your Taskbar and/or Window screens. It change the layout back to the original Windows 10 and before and remove unwanted bloatware that gets pre-installed on your system. It also gives you the option to install a preferred browser.
